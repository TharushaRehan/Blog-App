    title: "How to Build a Node Server in 10 Minutes",
    content: [
      `Building a Node server in just 10 minutes is an achievable goal, even for beginners. By following a streamlined process, you can have a basic server up and running in no time.`,
      `Start by creating a new folder for your project and initializing it with a package.json file, which serves as a configuration file for your project. This file can be easily generated by running the command npm init -y in your terminal.`,
      `Once your project is set up, you need to install the express package, a popular and user-friendly framework for building web servers in Node.js. The express package simplifies the process by providing a range of helpful features and functionalities. Install it by running the command npm install express in your terminal.`,
      `With the necessary dependencies installed, it's time to create a server.js file in your project folder. This file will contain the code for your server. Inside server.js, you will import the express module and create an instance of the express application.`,
      `To handle incoming requests, you'll define routes. Routes determine how your server responds to different URL paths and HTTP methods. For a simple example, you can create a route that responds with a "Hello, World!" message when the root URL is accessed.`,
      `Once you've defined your routes, you'll need to start the server. This involves adding code that makes your server listen for incoming requests on a specific port. You can choose any available port, such as 3000, and configure your server to listen on that port.`,
      `To launch the server, simply run the command node server.js in your terminal. This will execute your server.js file and start your Node server. You'll see a message in the terminal indicating that the server is running and listening for incoming requests.`,
      `In conclusion, building a Node server in 10 minutes involves setting up your project, installing the express package, creating a server.js file, defining routes, starting the server, and launching it. Following this streamlined process allows you to quickly get a basic Node server up and running, giving you a solid foundation to build upon for more advanced server development.`,
