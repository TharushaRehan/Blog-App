# Blog-App

I have designed and developed a user-friendly web application for blogging. This application allows bloggers to easily create and publish their content with minimum effort. The web app provides an engaging and interactive experience for both bloggers and readers alike.

Functionalities

1. User authentication (Firebase)
2. Read available articles (Both Logged In users and normal users)
3. Like the articles (Only for Logged In users)
4. Add comments to the articles (Only for Logged In users)
5. Add content to the app (Only for Logged In users)
